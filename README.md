# OpenWeatherMap.OneCall

This repository likely provides a C# client or wrapper for interacting with the [OpenWeatherMap One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) (version 3.0). The One Call API is a comprehensive solution for weather data, offering current, minute, hourly, and daily forecasts, as well as historical weather data and national weather alerts.

## Features

While specific features for this particular repository are not detailed, a typical C# client for the OpenWeatherMap One Call API would generally include:

* **Integration with OpenWeatherMap One Call API:** Seamlessly connect to the OpenWeatherMap service to fetch weather data.
* **Current Weather Data:** Retrieve real-time weather conditions for any geographical coordinate.
* **Forecasts:** Access minute (for 1 hour), hourly (for 48 hours), and daily (for 8 days) weather forecasts.
* **National Weather Alerts:** Obtain information on government weather alerts.

## Installation

You can install this library via NuGet Package Manager.

**NuGet Package:** [OpenWeatherMap.OneCall](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenWeatherMap.OneCall)

To install, use the .NET CLI:

```bash
dotnet add package OpenWeatherMap.OneCall
```

Or via Package Manager Console in Visual Studio:

```powershell
Install-Package OpenWeatherMap.OneCall
```

Alternatively, you can obtain the source code directly from this GitHub repository. Depending on the project structure, you might compile it or include it as a project reference in your C# solution.

## Usage

To utilize this client, you will need an API key from OpenWeatherMap. The One Call API (version 3.0) requires a subscription, but currently there is a free limit of 1000 requests a day.

Basic usage generally involves:

1.  **Obtaining an API Key:** Register on the [OpenWeatherMap website](https://openweathermap.org/) to get your unique API key.
2.  **Making API Calls:** Use the client to make requests to the One Call API, typically providing geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) and your API key.

```csharp
// Example (conceptual, actual implementation may vary)
var openWeatherMapClient = new OpenWeatherMapClient("YOUR_API_KEY");
var weatherData = await openWeatherMapClient.GetOneCallDataAsync(latitude, longitude);
Console.WriteLine($"Current Temperature: {weatherData.Current.Temperature}");
```

Please refer to the specific implementation within the repository for detailed instructions and available methods.
